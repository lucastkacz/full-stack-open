npm install --save-dev jest
The ESLint configuration we added to the project in the previous part 
complains about the test and expect commands in our test file since the
configuration does not allow globals. Let's get rid of the complaints 
by adding "jest": true to the env property in the .eslintrc.js file.

run tests individually:
npm test -- tests/note_api.test.js
The -t option can be used for running tests with a specific name:
npm test -- -t "a specific note is within the returned notes"

supertest package to help us write our tests for testing the API
npm install --save-dev supertest

One starts to wonder if it would be possible to refactor the code to eliminate the catch from the methods?
The express-async-errors library has a solution for this.
npm install express-async-errors
Because of the library, we do not need the next(exception) call anymore. The library handles everything under 
the hood. If an exception occurs in an async route, the execution is automatically passed to the error handling middleware.
